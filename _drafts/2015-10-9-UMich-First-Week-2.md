Welcome back! In this installment of my mini-series, I'm going to talk about some issues with the apartment that, honestly, could have been better thought out by management. As you read on, you will probably think, "Wow, Ryan is an awfully petty person!" But hopefully, a small part of you will also say, "Man, they could have thought things through a bit more." But I'm getting ahead of myself.

### Why Are These Drawers So Sticky?
When I moved in to my apartment, the first thing I noticed was that every surface was very sticky. The floor, the counters, the cupboard doors, you name it. I didn't dare touch anything without a thorough wipedown, lest I get sticky residue on my fingertips. Most things in there are made of veneered wood, and it was unusually humid during my first few days, so it was somewhat understandable. But even then, I found a decent number of hair strands, cobwebs, and insect carcasses, so it made me question the standard of "clean" that maintenance used to inspect my place.

### I Guess Graduate Students Don't Need Microwaves
My apartment is advertised as a fully-furnished apartment. I don't know if this was just a UMass thing, but I've come to expect microwaves in on-campus furnished apartments. After all, college students don't know how to _actually_ cook! We just microwave frozen dinners, ramen, and leftovers that magically appear in our fridge! But alas, the lack of a microwave created a hole in my apartment and in my heart. Turns out the easiest way to fill such a hole is to buy a new microwave from Target. _Expect More. Pay Less.&#8482;_

### "Modular" Furniture
So the furniture that comes with my apartment is supposedly "modular" (as advertised by the community center), so certain parts can be taken apart and rearranged in interesting ways. I became familiar with this concept during my time at UMass, where the beds could be raised or lowered by moving the springs up or down the rungs of the leg posts, and you could even loft by adding frames to the bottom. The hutch on the desks were removable as well. Because of this, I expected the same thing with the bed and desk that were included in my bedroom.

The apartment betrayed my expectation in two particularly annoying ways. First, the height of the bed cannot be adjusted at all. This was problematic for me because I needed to store my boxes underneath, but the bed was so low that nothing could fit! They make bed risers that go under the legs of the bed, but they wouldn't work with my bed because it has two long feet on each side instead of four at each corner. Second, the desk hutch was not actually removable without extra tools! Seriously, it was _screwed_ onto the desk! The included image gives a reasonable sense of how large it was compared to the desk. I wanted to have my external monitor on the desk, but the big fat shelf was thwarting my plans.

Thankfully, these problems were solvable, but I really wished it were easier. For the bed, it turned out that I could flip it upside-down; it was designed for stability and usage on both sides. I really turned the problem on its head! (Sorry.) As for the desk, all I could do was buy some hand tools and remove the offending screws, then the hutch. At least the hutch is as tall as the desk: I'm currently using it to extend my desk further back.

### And more...

I could go on for even longer (I haven't even talked about my plumbing issues, which required multiple trips from the service folks), but this post has gone on for long enough. I'll save my plumbing stories for later, but for now, you're probably aching to hear about the accident that landed me in the hospital! If so, head on over to part 3 of my mini-series! I promise to post it sometime before my candidate exams.
