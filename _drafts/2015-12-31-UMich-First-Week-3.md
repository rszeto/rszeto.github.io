Welcome back! I assume you've read parts 1 and 2 of this mini-series. If not, please read at least part 1, which gives the context for my upcoming story.

So far, this mini-series has covered issues with my apartment and moving in that, to be honest, might seem more like overly whiny complaints than serious issues. If you find yourself agreeing with this view and are on the verge of apathy, worry not, for in this section, I will be discussing the incident that _truly_ ruined my entire week. In fact, it even escalated to a visit to the emergency room.

So when did this whole mess start? Well, perhaps I'll begin on Wednesday morning, the day after I moved my things in to the apartment. At this point, I had barely unpacked, since we were focusing on buying things we forgot and cleaning the surfaces in the apartment. There was also an orientation that took up a few hours, so I would have to wait to unpack until the evening. Anyways, do you remember the bug bite on my right Achilles heel that I mentioned in part 1? At this point, it had gotten a bit bigger to the point where I could feel a small bump against the tendon. Perhaps I should have suspected something unusual at this point, but I never had a bite on my Achilles before; I figured it made sense for the bite to swell up a little bit in all directions. So during the morning and the orientation, I walked around more or less as usual, shifting my weight a bit to the left to put less strain on my right foot.

After the orientation, my parents picked me up and drove me to Home Depot to buy some wood and a shower strainer. I limped a bit to the front of the store, and by the time I entered, I realized that it _really_ hurt to walk on my right foot. After standing at the store entrance like a flamingo for a few minutes, a store employee kindly offered to bring me an electric store cart. Despite the potential judgement I would face by customers thinking that I was driving the cart out of laziness, I accepted the offer. Not that I would recommend the cart to even the laziest of people. It was horrendously slow, moving at about fifty percent of walking speed. It was also painful to navigate around the obstacles scattered about the cluttered aisles. The frustration only grew as my mom made me drive up and down the store for the items she wanted me to get. I voiced my reluctance, which only made my mom, who did not seem to understand how tedious it was to drive a slow cart around a massive store, even more upset.

Eventually, we finished our business at Home Depot and shifted our attention to seeking medical attention for my leg. After talking with a pharmacist from CVS, we received the address of a nearby emergency clinic. When we arrived, the clerk told us that that particular clinic did not accept our Massachusetts-based medical insurance. She told us that another clinic across town would accept our insurance, but that it would close at 8pm. By that point, it was around 7:30pm, so we rushed to the other clinic as fast as we could without violating traffic laws. We were thrown off and delayed by the discovery that our new destination was under a different name from that provided by Google Maps, but we managed to arrive with about 5 minutes to spare. At this point, the swelling had spread about a third of the way up my leg. The doctor informed us that I had cellulitis, a major bacterial infection. After giving me crutches and a prescription for antibiotics, she told us to come back between 24-48 hours to make sure it didn't spread further. After picking up dinner and the prescription, my parents dropped me off at my apartment, and I went to sleep to wrap up my first day in hell.

The next day, I had my first lab meeting in the EECS building, a building far away from any parking lots that we knew of at the time. Hoping to outsmart the problem, I had my dad drop me off north of EECS, up the hill from where my meeting took place. Unfortunately, I did not save any time or effort at all; I had to go through several doors and down a few stairs to get to my destination. Despite my stumbling into the meeting room several minutes late, audibly exhausted from my journey through several buildings on crutches, my labmates warmly welcomed me and continued the meeting without fuss.

* Next day, had a meeting not close to any parking lots we knew of
* Walked into a few wrong buildings on the way to my meeting
* Came in a few minutes late, but it was fine
* Left building and had to cross the diag to get to parking lot
* Stayed in apartment for a while since sink repairman came, and mom did not trust him enough to leave for dinner

* Got to block with Totoro restaurant, but couldn't find it
* Dad parked in parking garage on other side of block, so I had to use crutches to go around the entire block
* Eventually found Totoro, which had a small sign and was deep inside the building
* Foot in a lot of pain throughout dinner
* Got back to apartment and slept

* Went to health clinic Friday morning, was told that I definitely need to go to ER
* Got hooked up to IV, sat around and watched TV, sent emails, called people
* Sort of slept, but was hard because open door and nurse coming in for IV during the early morning
* Stayed until Saturday afternoon, still hurt to put weight on right foot but was getting better
* Over next few days, still rush of pain when I lowered my leg from an elevated position
* By Tuesday, still swollen but no more pain!
