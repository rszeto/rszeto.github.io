Welcome back! In this installment of my mini-series, I want to talk about the major plumbing issues I had with my apartment. Allegedly, inspectors came in to make sure everything in the apartment was working, but I really have no clue how these problems were missed.

### Is The Faucet Base Supposed To Move That Much?
* Movable faucet base
* Leaky faucet
* "What do you do when the garbage disposal blades fuse with the case?"

### The Shower Water Was The Color Of My Feces On A Good Day, So I Cleaned Myself With A Soup Bowl
* Shower head too short
* Two knobs
* Water comes out of shower and bath heads
* Poop water
* Turns out the pipes inside the bath head were completely corroded. "There was nothing to grab on to. As soon as I pulled out the head, it completely fell apart."
