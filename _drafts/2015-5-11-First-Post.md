Hello everyone! I am writing this post to commemorate my graduation from UMass, and also the birth of this website! Personal websites are what all the cool kids are doing, so I figured I'd give it a shot! :P

At this point, I'm still learning how to use Jekyll (the generator I'm using to produce this site), so things look pretty basic right now. Also, some pages like the about and home screens are completely junk. Not to worry, things will look more reasonable soon!

This site is where I will describe the research I am doing, as well as give updates on how my life is going so far. So keep checking back for updates! See you next time.
