news-line: I got a paper on PAOL accepted at MTEL 2015!
---
A paper that I worked on during my time at RIPPLES (UMass), "Portable Lecture Capture that Captures the Complete Lecture", will be published at a workshop! This is my first paper publication, so I'm really excited!

The workshop is the IEEE International Workshop on Multimedia Technologies for E-Learning (MTEL), held this year in Miami. It would be great to go there and present the contributions I made, although I'm not sure how that works since I'm not a UMass student anymore. If I go, I will be sure to post pictures. :)
