Hi everyone! I have more or less settled into Michigan at this point, so I would like to greet you from the comfort of my own hospital room! (I'll explain why I'm here later). Since I can't do too much else right now, I figured I would write a few posts to talk about how my first week went (just one will not suffice). Spoiler alert: It was pretty awful.

Let me start this mini-series by talking about my arrival in Ann Arbor. When I got on campus, the first thing I did was visit the Northwood Community Center to pick up the keys to my apartment. For those who don't know, Northwood is an on-campus living area that provides apartments for upper-level undergrads and graduates. After picking up my keys, we drove over to my apartment and got ready to move in.

As I stepped out of my car and started walking over towards my apartment, I pulled out my key. Imagine my surprise when I saw a card reader on my door instead of a regular door lock! I called the community center to ask why I got a normal key instead of a card, and their response was that I should come back so they can make me a card key. It'll only take a few minutes, they said. Fair enough. I went back to the community center and had a seat on one of their sofas.

Ten minutes into my visit, they told me they had to wait for their supervisor to come in, since only a few people have accounts for the card maker. Thirty minutes in, the supervisor came in and logged in to the machine, but she was having trouble getting it to work. Fifty minutes in, I was told to call security to have them let me in to my apartment. I did just that, but the lady on the phone kept refusing to let me in to my own apartment for whatever reason. I handed my phone over to the supervisor, who explained the situation and eventually convinced the stubborn lady. After that mess, I got to return to my apartment and wait for twenty more minutes for security to come let me in without further hassle.

During the rest of the day, I went to some stores to pick up extra items for my apartment. At some point, I noticed that I had a small bug bite on my Achilles heel. This was an insignificant event at the time, but it would eventually come to bite me in the butt (or ankle, rather) and ruin the rest of my week...
