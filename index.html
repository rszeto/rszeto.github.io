      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>I am a Computer Science and Engineering Ph.D. candidate at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, working with {% include f/person_text person_id="jjcorso" use_title=true %} in computer vision. My current research explores conditional video generation as applied to tasks like video prediction and video frame inpainting.</p>
      <p>In 2019, I did an internship at Samsung Semiconductor, Inc. in San Diego. Advised by {% include f/person_text person_id="mostafa" use_title=true %}, I developed a method to apply image style transfer and inpainting models to videos in a temporally-consistent manner.
      <p>In 2017, I did an internship at Toyota Research Institute in Cambridge under the advisement of {% include f/person_text person_id="sstent" use_title=true %} and {% include f/person_text person_id="gros" use_title=true %}, where I compared the modeling and generalization performance of multiple state-of-the-art video prediction networks with a novel dataset.</p>
      <p>In 2015, I graduated summa cum laude from the University of Massachusetts in Amherst, where I received B.S. degrees in Computer Science and Mathematics. At UMass, I did research as part of the RIPPLES lab under {% include f/person_text person_id="adrion" use_title=true %} and {% include f/person_text person_id="pdickson" use_title=true %}. I worked on various aspects of the lab's Presentations Automatically Organized from Lectures (PAOL) system, including video conversion, whiteboard processing, multithreading, and the graphical user interface. For my Honors Thesis project, I proposed and evaluated a novel technique for segmenting whiteboard marker strokes in real time. Additionally, I was briefly a member of the <a href="http://edesign.ecs.umass.edu/">Center for e-Design</a> under the instruction of {% include f/person_text person_id="wileden" use_title=true %} and {% include f/person_text person_id="skrishna" use_title=true %}, where I worked on a program that converted models between Computer-Aided Design systems.</p>
