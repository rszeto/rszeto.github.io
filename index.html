      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>I am a second-year Computer Science and Engineering Ph.D. student at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, working with <a href="http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~jjcorso/">Prof. Jason J. Corso</a> in computer vision. I am interested in structured deep learning, especially applied to vision and language problems. I graduated summa cum laude from University of Massachusetts Amherst in 2015, where I received two B.S. degrees, one in Computer Science and another in Mathematics. During my junior year, I was inducted into the UMass Amherst chapter of Phi Beta Kappa.</p>
      <p>The majority of my research at UMass was as a member of the RIPPLES lab, which specializes in new software systems for capturing and presenting lectures and is directed by <a href="https://people.cs.umass.edu/~adrion/">Dr. Rick Adrion</a>. I worked on various aspects of the Presentations Automatically Organized from Lectures system, including video conversion, whiteboard processing, multithreading, and the graphical user interface.</p>
      </p>During the 2012 spring and fall semesters, I was a member of the <a href="http://edesign.ecs.umass.edu/">Center for e-Design</a> under the instruction of <a href="https://www.cics.umass.edu/faculty/directory/wileden_jack">Dr. Jack Wileden</a> and <a href="https://mie.umass.edu/faculty/sundar-krishnamurty">Dr. Sundar Krishnamurty</a>, where I primarily worked on a program that converted models between Computer-Aided Design systems.</p>
      <p>I was also a member of UMass' Commonwealth Honors College (CHC), where I graduated as a Commonwealth Honors College Scholar with Greatest Distinction. As part of CHC's Departmental Honors track, I completed an Honors Thesis on detecting marker strokes from whiteboard images efficiently. The CHC provided multiple awards to support my work, including the Research Assistant Fellowship, the Honors Research Grant, and the Honors Dean's Award.</p>
      <p>From the former UMass School of Computer Science (now the College of Information and Computer Sciences), I received the Outstanding Achievement in Artificial Intelligence Award, which is given to a top student who has excelled in both academic and research-oriented endeavors in AI. I also received the Cisco Award for Outstanding Achievement and course commendations in many classes.</p>
